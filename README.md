# IBM Quantum Computing Workshop 2018

***Description:** To be added.*

## Structure

You'll find several folders in this repo, which contain all the content created during this workshop. The main structure is as follows:

- üìÅ **[docs](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/IBMQC18/tree/master/docs):** Contains all documentation (slides, papers, etc.) reviewed or recommended during the workshop.

For this workshop [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) will be needed, and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) will be very useful.

Install the ***"[Open Source Quantum Information Science Kit](https://qiskit.org/)"*** (*[QISKit](https://qiskit.org/)*) directly with `pip` as follows:

```bash
[python3] $ pip install qiskit
```

We'll run some `qiskit` examples (found in the offial repo [QISKit/qiskit-tutorial](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial)) inside an IBM quantum computer, so we'll need extra installations. To do so, please follow the instructions from ***[HERE](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/INSTALL.md)***.

##### TL;DR:
1. Clone the [QISKit/qiskit-tutorial](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial.git
```

2. If you use [Conda/Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) I highly recommend you to create a virtual environment as follows (after clonning `qiskit-tutorial`):
```bash
cd qiskit-tutorial
conda env create -f QISKitenv.yml
```
